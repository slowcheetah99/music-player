                "Calling BTS a boy band is a little like calling a computer a typewriter with a screen. Yes, they sing. Yes, they dance. Yes, they have cool haircuts and their outfits always match in an interesting way. But they also represent the power of pop music—simple, catchy pop music—as a force for social transformation, touching on subjects—mental health, LGBTQ identity, class inequity—taboo not just in their native South Korea but in the sunshine-and-rainbows world of mass-market culture generally. The official name of their fans (the ARMY), is an acronym for “Adorable Representative MC for Youth.” But the subtext is clear: These are people willing to fight for what they believe.<br>\nFormed in 2010 by K-pop impresario Bang Si-hyuk, the group—V, j-hope, RM, Jin, Jimin, Jungkook, and SUGA—swiftly became not only one of the biggest groups in South Korea (and eventually the best-selling artists in the country’s history), but an emblem for K-pop’s migration into mainstream global pop—a feat made even more impressive by the fact that the band sings almost entirely in Korean. More than just developing a brand, BTS crafted a rich, reference-heavy alternate universe that invoked things like Jungian psychoanalysis and Nietzschean philosophy—not your most bankable teen-pop references. (The video to their 2016 track “Blood Sweat & Tears” is, if not the only music video in history to feature both a coordinated dance routine and a quote from the Hermann Hesse novel <I>Demian</I>, certainly the only one to have been watched more than half a billion times.)<br>\nBut for as dense as the band’s mythology can get, their presence remains simple, clear, and uplifting. In 2017, they partnered with UNICEF in a campaign to protect young people from violence; the next year, their fans raised over $1 million in an effort to alleviate childhood malnutrition. SUGA once promised that if he got rich, he would buy his fans beef—a luxury in Korea. On his 25th birthday, he donated nearly $20,000 of it to orphanages. And he did it in ARMY’s name.",

                "As the leader of the hugely popular South Korean boy band BTS, RM is known for his natural rap flow, introspective lyrics, and role as group spokesperson overseas.\n\n• Growing up, RM had an interest in writing and poetry, and he even won literary awards as a student. He developed his love for hip-hop by listening to artists like Epik High and Eminem.\n• When BTS debuted in 2013, RM was originally known as “Rap Monster,” a stage name he used while training with his bandmates before hitting the K-pop industry. After using RM informally in interviews, he formally announced the name change in November 2017.\n• While he mainly raps in BTS, RM's <i>mono.</i> mixtape—which he described as a “playlist”—showcases his wide range of music interests. The track “seoul” is a lo-fi electro-pop song produced by the British duo HONNE, while “everythingoes” is a collaboration with South Korean indie rockers Nell.\n• RM has shown his versatility by rapping on tracks from all types of artists, including hip-hop veterans (Warren G, MFBTY's Tiger JK and Yoonmirae, Gaeko, and Wale), rock bands (Fall Out Boy), power vocalists (Younha), and fellow genre hoppers like Lil Nas X, with whom he crafted the “Seoul Town Road Remix.”\n",

                "Born Kim Woo-sung, this Korean-American lead vocalist and guitarist for the Seoul-based melodic indie rock quartet the Rose employs slick R&B and 1980s pop-inspired stylings on his solo material. The Rose placed multiple EPs and singles on Billboard's World chart between 2017 and 2019, toured the globe, and received a Most Promising Artist prize at the 2018 International K-Music Awards. 2019 brought Woo-sung's first flurry of solo activity, and he made prestigious appearances on the South Korean TV shows After School Club and JTBC SuperBand before releasing his debut EP, Wolf. In 2021, he launched his own label, Woolfpack, which issued his second EP, Genre, the first on which he used the simple mononym Woosung.",

                "Known as TXT, the five-member K-pop group TOMORROW x TOGETHER has “come together under one dream in hopes of building a better tomorrow.”\n\n• The first boy band from South Korean company Big Hit Entertainment since the launch of global superstars BTS in 2013, TXT has been a high-profile act in the K-pop scene since their earliest days. \n• The group pairs its effervescent electro-pop with a fictional storyline known as the TU, or TXT Universe, which is used to explore themes relating to youth and relationships.\n• TXT’s first release trilogy, <i>The Dream Chapter</i>, began with their 2019 debut EP, <i>The Dream Chapter: STAR</i>. The two follow-up installments, <i>Magic</i> and <i>Eternity</i>, both went platinum in the group’s native South Korea.\n• TXT sometimes drop alternate versions of their songs—check out their English rendition of “Cat & Dog” and acoustic mix of “Our Summer.” They also regularly release versions of their songs in Japanese.",
